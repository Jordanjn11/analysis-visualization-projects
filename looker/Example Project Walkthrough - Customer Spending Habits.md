--Example Project - Customer Spending Habits (BI tools used = Google Sheets, Looker)

--1. Downloaded dataset from Kaggle: "Spending Habits by Category and Item" - spending_patterns_detailed.csv (793.84 kB)
--2. Renamed CSV file to transactions-by-customer-item-sale_spending-patterns-detailed.csv
--- Why: While retaining the original file name, the rename improved  metadocumentation (records are at the individual Transaction level, with attributes of the Item, the Customer, and the Sale)
